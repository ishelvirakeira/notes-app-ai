### Project Overview
This project is a notes application that I upgraded with two AI-powered features, an AI rewriting tool and an AI summarizer. Users can rewrite any note in different tones (concise, professional, friendly) or instantly generate a short, clear summary of longer text. These features show how I integrate LLMs APIs into real applications to improve everyday workflows while keeping the experience fast, intuitive, and user-focused.
I built this project to demonstrate my ability to prototype AI features quickly, design AI-first interfaces, and ship functional tools under tight timelines.
